# cpp_stuf ☆彡

welcome to your cozy collection of C++ experiments projects and tiny utilities  
this repo is the warm home for all your cpp creations where each file is a little sparkly idea ｡･:*:･ﾟ✧

 ✿･ﾟ: *✧

* what this repo is for
  * a personal place to keep fun C++ code snippets mini projects and learning exercises
  * a gentle catalog of things you build while exploring the language and making cute programs

* how to use this collection
  * browse the files to find projects you want to run or improve
  * each example usually has a short comment or its own file level notes explaining how to try it
  * compile simple programs with a local C++ compiler for example
  ```bash
  g++ Pet_Simulator.cpp -o pet_simulator
  ./pet_simulator
  ```
  * follow the on screen prompts and enjoy the little pet moments

｡･:*:･ﾟ★ Pet Simulator guide ✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:

this section explains the Pet_Simulator.cpp file and how to play with it and expand it

* what Pet_Simulator.cpp is
  * a playful console program written in C++ that lets you pick a pet and then play feed or tuck it into bed
  * demonstrates basic input output branching and cozy text interaction
  * beginner friendly and lovely for practicing control flow and console IO

* features you will see when you run it
  * choose a new pet and receive a cute confirmation ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
  * play with your pet by choosing a toy ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶
  * feed your pet with tasty options (っ˘ڡ˘ς)
  * put your pet to sleep in a comfy spot zzZ (˘o˘)zzZ
  * view simple static pet stats or say goodbye with sparkles ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

☆彡 project organization ideas ｡･:*:･ﾟ✧

* keep small experiments as single cpp files for quick compile and test
* group related projects into folders for example games algorithms utilities or experiments
* add a short header comment at the top of each file describing purpose inputs and how to run it
* when a project grows make a folder with a dedicated read me and sample run commands

* ideas to grow this collection
  * add save and load so the pet can persist between sessions
  * add a folder for mini game mechanics and a folder for tiny tools
  * create a project template read me to keep each new file consistent and cute

* contributing notes
  * add new files for experiments or small projects
  * keep file names descriptive and add small comments so future you can remember what each file does
  * if you want i can help create a CONTRIBUTING file or a template for new project read mes

thank you for creating a gentle sparkly world of C++ code here ☆･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:*
